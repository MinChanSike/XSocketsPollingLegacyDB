=====================================

A realtime communication demo based on XSockets.NET, Wijmo, KnockoutJS, TwitterBootstrap and EF CF MSSQL as DataSource 

## What this?
A answer to a question on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14319758/signalr-polling-database-for-updates/14326800#14326800

The project was built as a proof of concept on what you can do with XSockets.NET
as a realtime backend.

In the package is a readme.txt where all the steps is documented.

(Package may be updated in the future)
